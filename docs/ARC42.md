# Introduction and Goals

DAPS Registration Service is a central Catena-X Service, which allows
registering connectors remotely in Catena-X DAPS service. This Service
can be used by all operators of connectors:

-   The operators of on-pram connector

-   Operators of managed connectors

## Requirements Overview

### High level requirement

DAPS registration service mediates the calls between authenticated
requestor and DAPS. It requires Keycloak and DAPS. A caller who manages
clients in DAPS shall be registered in DAPS and hold a role allowing him
to perform a call. Role names are configurable in DAPS registration
service configuration file.

## Quality Goals

The following table describes the key quality objectives of SDE.

# Architecture Constraints

Registration service can be running only under the Catena-X domain

# System Scope and Context

## ![](images/image2.png)

## Business Context

DAPS registration service sits between DAPS service and Connector
Operator. DAPS service provides a remote configuration plugin on its
own, however, it relies on its own authentication system, based on
OpenID Connect, which is not directly compatible with the one used in
Catena-X. Registration service uses Catena-X\'s keycloak to authenticate
a caller. If the caller is authenticated and authorized (has an
appropriate role) then the call is transferred to the DAPS remote
configuration plugin. With this plugin, new clients can be registered or
unregistered at DAPS, and their registration details can be updated.

## Technical Context

### **Information needed for Connector registration in DAPS:**

-   The endpoint of the DAPS registration service

-   Connector certificate (see How to create a certificate)

-   The endpoint of the connector (possible BPN of the connector if need
    to include it in the DAT. In this case, BPN is added at the end of
    referringConnector)

## How to create a certificate:

**For release 2 we use self-sign certificate:**

To create self signed certificate, please follow the below steps.

-   ```openssl req -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout connector-example.key -out connector-example.crt```

-   ```openssl pkcs12 -export -name 1 -out connector-example.p12 -inkey connector-example.key -in connector-example.crt```

-   ```openssl rsa -in connector-example.key -pubout -out connector-example.pub```

-   Send us the .crt file, url and fqdn name to process for registration
    in DAPS.

## DAPS Registration API:

To register a Certificate to the DAPS an authenticated client (known
client with an appropriate role, a concrete role can be configured in
the configuration file) sends POST multipart request to the DAPS
registration service endpoint

Media Type: multipart/form-data

POST /api/v1/daps

here is the interface definition in java:

```
    Map<String, Object> createClientPost(
        @Parameter(name = "clientName", description = "Name of a client we create a record for", required = true) @Valid @RequestParam(value = "clientName", required = true) String clientName,
        @Parameter(name = "referringConnector", description = "URL of a connector with BPN at the end", required = true) @Valid @RequestParam(value = "referringConnector", required = true) URI referringConnector,
        @Parameter(name = "file", description = "Certificate of a Connector in PEM format", required = true) @RequestPart(value = "file", required = true) MultipartFile file,
        @Parameter(name = "securityProfile", description = "The profile. Default value is idsc:BASE_SECURITY_PROFILE") @Valid @RequestParam(value = "securityProfile", required = false) String securityProfile
    )
```
parameter securityProfile is optional if missed then the default value is used.
The response includes a static data given in `application.yml` and `clientId` inferred from the client 
certificate. Static data contains JWKS url by default. Here is an example:

```
    {
        "daps_jwks": "https://daps.int.demo.catena-x.net/jwks.json",
        "clientId" : "65:FA:DE:C2:6A..."
    }
```

## Solution Strategy

For user authentication, Connector Registration Service relies on the
Catena-X identity provider (keycloak). Connector Registration Service
has access to a secret that allows using the remote administration
plugin of the DAPS.

## Building Block View

![](images/image3.png) 

## Whitebox Overall System

-   RESTful interface receives requests from an actor for creating,
    updating, and deleting clients at DAPS. The request needs to be
    authenticated and authorised in order to proceed. Catena-X keycloak
    is used for authentication purposes
    
-   Query adapter transforms a request coming from Actor to the format
    acceptable by DAPS remote administration plugin

-   DAPS secret allows the query adapter to call DAPS and perform admin
    operations on it. Thus, we keep this secret on the Registration
    Service side and do not disclose it to the Actor
